# Plugins
Auto-format on save for Rust file, rust-analyzer, inlay hints, mason.
Not a many plugins due to the productivity first mentality and NvChad also has a lot of really cool features built in, so no more plugins needed at the moment.

# Don't forget
`:Lazy sync`

`:Mason` -> `/rust-analyzer`, `/lua-language-server`...
